## PCE in Groundwater May 2012
My first exposure to data visualization was in my GIS minor in college. I then applied that knowledge in the early days of my career as a geologist. I conducted fieldwork collecting groundwater samples and then mapped those samples’ chemical concentrations using ArcGIS. This example data was sourced from [GeoTracker](https://geotracker.waterboards.ca.gov/profile_report?global_id=SLT3S5581367) and was not a client project.

## Percentage of Women in the Workforce
This was one of my first explorations into creating more stylized data visualizations designed for print or posters. I sourced the data from the Women Entrepreneurship Index and Global Entrepreneurship Index Report and designed it with the use of Charticulator, a Microsoft tool.

## Mom’s Travel Calendar
As a retirement gift for my mom, who plans her travels years ahead, I transformed her itineraries into a poster using ArcGIS and Adobe Illustrator, which I then attached to a corkboard for her office. This personal project is close to my heart, showcasing how data visualization can capture personal histories and futures.

## Vegetable Planting Guide
This data visualization answers the question: When is the best time to plant in your Coastal Northern California vegetable garden? 

The traditional 12 month calendar was converted into a circle to represent the continuous nature of time and the planting cycle. The data for this project was acquired online from Table 14.2, pages 351-352 in California Master Gardener Handbook. Nancy Garrison and Dennis R. Pittenger. 2002.

## The Rise of the Electric Vehicle in the U.S.
This visualization tells the story of the electric vehicle in the us over approximately the past decade. In 2000 hybrid vehicles were first sold and took off. In 2010 electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles were introduced to the Market. Hybrid Electric vehicles still outnumber electric and pug-in hybrid electric. 

The data for this visualized was sourced from the National Transportation Statistics 2021 Annual Report, which is a publicly available document.
