# Data Visualization
In this section, I'll take you through a chronological journey of how I developed an interest in data visualization and share some of the projects I've worked on along the way.

## Figure 1: PCE in Groundwater May 2012
In the early days of my career as a geologist, I conducted fieldwork collecting groundwater samples and then mapped those samples’ chemical concentrations using ArcGIS. This environmental consulting figure represents this foundational data visualization work.

## Figure 2: Percent of Women in the Workforce
This was one of my first explorations into creating more stylized data visualizations designed for print or posters. I sourced the data from the Women Entrepreneurship Index and Global Entrepreneurship Index Report and designed it with the use of Charticulator, a Microsoft tool.

## Figure 3: Mom’s Travel Calendar
As a retirement gift for my mom, who plans her travels years ahead, I transformed her itineraries into a poster using ArcGIS and Adobe Illustrator, which I then attached to a corkboard for her office. It's a personal project close to my heart, showcasing how data visualization can capture personal histories and futures.

## Figure 4: Studio Album Release Dates
This simple visualization of album release dates tells a complex story of these classic rock bands and the impact they’ve had on music history. I made this chart using RawGraphs, which is a tool built on top of D3.js, a library I am determined to master.
