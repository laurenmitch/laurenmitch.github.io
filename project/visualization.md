![PCE in Groundwater Visualization](/img/full/viz_water.png)

## PCE in Groundwater May 2012
My first exposure to data visualization was in my GIS minor in college. I then applied that knowledge in the early days of my career as a geologist. I conducted fieldwork collecting groundwater samples and then mapped those samples’ chemical concentrations using ArcGIS. This example data was sourced from [GeoTracker](https://geotracker.waterboards.ca.gov/profile_report?global_id=SLT3S5581367) and was not a client project.

## Percentage of Women in the Workforce
This was one of my first explorations into creating more stylized data visualizations designed for print or posters. I sourced the data from the Women Entrepreneurship Index and Global Entrepreneurship Index Report and designed it with the use of Charticulator, a Microsoft tool.

## Mom’s Travel Calendar
As a retirement gift for my mom, who plans her travels years ahead, I transformed her itineraries into a poster using ArcGIS and Adobe Illustrator, which I then attached to a corkboard for her office. This personal project is close to my heart, showcasing how data visualization can capture personal histories and futures.
